There’s lots of technical implications around monetary policy and fiscal policy, but the bottom line is about resource allocation: If money is just a stand in for the free trade bartering that drives societal wealth, then its hard to argue with the Chicago school line that the free market creates the optimal allocation of resources. If instead banks dictate the creation and destruction of money, then what we can <em>afford</em> takes on an entirely new meaning.</p> <p>It’s easy to think of money as being a time travel vehicle for savings— money earned in the past allows you to do something in the future— but it seems more appropriate in light of endogenous money to view money as fundamentally a vehicle for trust: I trust you to do something for me, and money allows that trust to be traded and used elsewhere in society.</p> <div class="flex w-fit mx-auto">~$﹩＄~</div> <h3>How banks create money</h3> <p>So what do we mean that banks create money by making loans? The explanation lies with accounting identities, which we’ll introduce here briefly and then get to the good stuff.</p> <p>This is a <strong>T-Account</strong>, the fundamental unit of double entry book-keeping and the tool we’ll use to examine exactly what happens when a bank makes a loan.</p> <div class="flex w-fit mx-auto flex-col"><!> <div class="self-center text-xs mt-1">T-Account</div></div> <p>Double entry book-keeping dates back more than 750 years to 1200s Italy. It transformed the way commerce was conducted by allowing the accurate management of vast commercial enterprises. Combined with convenient location, it is a key reason that Venetian banking houses were able to become powerfully influential across Europe over the following several hundred years.</p> <p>The idea is deceptively simple: Every entry in a double entry book-keeping system must be balanced. There are two things that can be affected by any transaction— what you <!> and what you <!>. A T-Account helps us keep track of what we own and owe for a variety of asset types. What you own can go up or down, as can what you owe. When what you own goes up or what you owe goes down, we’ll paint it <!>, and vice versa increased owing or decreased owning will be <!>.</p> <p>For instance if I start with $0 and then receive a loan of $100 from my sister, my cash account would look like this:</p> <div class="flex w-fit mx-auto flex-col"><!></div> <p>We typically use multiple T-Accounts to represent different kinds of things, so every debit in a given T Account is of the same type:</p> <div class="flex w-full justify-between"></div> <p>But going forward we’ll just lump them all into one. Let’s do an example. Here you start with $2,000, then buy a car for $2,000.
