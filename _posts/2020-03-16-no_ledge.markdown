I have a new project called [noledge](github.com/wrgoldstein/noledge) which is a way of tackling the [knowledge sharing](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/scaling-knowledge-at-airbnb-875d73eff091) problem. Similar projects include:

- [knowledge-repo](https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo)
- [kyso.io](kyso.io)
- [fastpages](github.com/fastai/fastpages)

My reasons for making one myself are:
- knowledge-repo is no longer actively supported and is a strange developer experience
- kyso is also kind of a weird developer experience. My project is most similar to it though.
- fastpages is open and hard to add authentication to, so it's not a good solution for internal knowledge sharing.

It's features are:
- Automatically convert .ipynb files to attractive html pages with the ability to hide code
- Automatically read posts from a github repository
- Search posts by title or author
- Scan posts by date or through a directory structure
