Couldn't you argue that DAG style software architecture is highly suited
to LLM centric development? The contextual traversal of a complex codebase is
pretty bad for an LLM I think? I.e. the chance that a change could affect some other
part of the code base?

And that's also.. what's hard for beginner developers. There's this huge group
of people who can like hack a script to make it work in a small (linear) context,
but couldn't put together a complex system.

in theory a dag based system where information flow is unidirectional and the boundaries between nodes is clearly contracted... it should be a safer place for an AI to play.
