Came across the article [Habits of Highly Mathematical People](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/habits-of-highly-mathematical-people-b719df12d15e#.th5k031k1) on [Medium](https://medium.com) earlier today.

Having just created a presentation introducing some concepts of analytical thinking for a nontechnical audience, I immediately thought this would also make an awesome workshop topic.

Getting end users (e.g. executives or product managers) to nail down exact definitions often seems to be the most important step in doing productive analytics work.

Maybe for the next offsite.
